## Getting Started

Convert and deploy a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) application into a npm package that can be installed on all systems by leveraging cargo.

A valid `license` set if you want to deploy to crates.io (we may auto fill it in the future).
You may want to add the following to your `.gitignore` and just reference the project being made with.

For shipping projects to github and releasing with binary installs check out the [cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist) project.

```sh
package.json
start.js
uninstall.js
pre-install.js
```

## Installation

Installs can be handled with cargo or npm using the following:

```sh
# install with cargo
cargo install rust-to-npm-cli
# install with npm
npm i rust-to-npm-cli -g
```

You can also use the crate directly at [rust-to-npm](./rust-to-npm/) with `cargo install rust-to-npm`.

## Account Login

The cargo crates and npm packages you are deploying should be linked to an account for their respective package managers.

Login to your crates.io account:
```sh
cargo login
```

Login to your npm account:
```sh
npm adduser
```

## Usage

Run the command inside the repo with the Cargo.toml file to deploy to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```sh
# to build locally without deploying
rust-to-npm-cli build
# to build and deploy to cargo + npm
rust-to-npm-cli deploy -b
```

You can also pass in the `-n` option on `build & deploy` in order to use a custom npm package name ex: `rust-to-npm-cli build -n @myorg/rust-to-npm-cli`

### Consuming

To use the node_module you just published run `npm i $PACKAGE_NAME --features=somefeature,nextfeature`.

Then use it via node `node node_modules/$PACKAGE_NAME/start.js`. Replace `$PACKAGE_NAME` with your package name as kebab case.
You can also import the module directly at root as a normal module in js like `require("node_modules/$PACKAGE_NAME")`.
The features arg is an optional comma seperated list to use for cargo.

## Goals

1. Easy convert installs to `npm`.
1. Allows full transparency of Rust code that user installs instead of dangerous binaries.

## Steps on how it works

1. convert Cargo.toml to package.json equivalent.
1. `pre-install` script that builds the rust project to the OS.
1. `start` script that executes the binary easily in nodejs.
1. `uninstall` script that removes the binary.

Here is an example of the output from the Cargo.toml to package.json file in the repo.

```

## Options

Run the CLI with `--npm_package_name` in order to add a custom package name for npm to use ( good for org packages ).
Use `--source` for shipping and compiling the project from source code.

## About

This project is used to convert the [A11yWatch CLI](https://github.com/a11ywatch/a11ywatch) for usage in node.

See example usage converting the [rust crawler](https://github.com/a11ywatch/crawler) library as a sidecar into a [node project](https://github.com/a11ywatch/sidecar).
